## USING JOINS TO FETCH DATA FROM MULTIPLE TABLES ##

## In addition to seeing film data, we want to calculate how much each film made in revenue,
## however film data and revenue data are stored in separate tables. So, joins were used to find
## relationships between the datasets and combine their records.
